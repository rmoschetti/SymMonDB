# SymMonDB - partial results

These lists are just partial reduction: due to some cases being memory intensive, a MonteCarlo algorithm is used to first reduce the number of cases. However, it could still be the cases that two elements

(a0, a1, ... ak) : n_a,
(b0, b1, ... bk) : n_b,

are equivalent up to the group action, and thus should be reduced to

(a0, a1, ... ak) : n_a+n_b,
